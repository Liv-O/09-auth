## 📖 About the Project

This project demonstrates a basic authentication flow in a Next.js application, including:

- User login and authentication logic
- Public and private routes
- Protected pages accessible only to authenticated users
- Form handling and validation
- Authentication logic is implemented using: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session handling,
                                             Cookies for storing authentication tokens
                                             Protected routes that restrict access for unauthorized users

The project can be used as a foundation for applications that require secure user access.
